## About
BoxShooter is a course project that displays several instances of Game Design elements within the unity framework, it includes:

## Installation
The project was exported as a WebGL group of files, as such you will need a modern browser in order to play it, simply download the package and open the **index.html** to play the game.

## How to Play
Control the player, as you try to shoot the boxes that spawn, while the timer counts down, use your mouse to aim and left click to shoot. There are 4 types of boxes, **green** boxes increase your score, **white** boxes add more time to the timer, **orange** boxes reduce the timer by a set amount and **purple** boxes reduce your time and give you points. When you've passed the stage or your time is up, appropriate text will spawn in game for you to continue to the next level or restart the game.

## Known Issues
Due to the game needing to hide the mouse cursor, it becomes difficult to aim until you click on your browsers popup when asked to hide your cursor, this would not be an issue if the game was a native application.
